Stateful vs Stateless Example

The component hierarchy:

	-contact: main component

		-searchBar: shows an input field so the user can filter the contacts

		-contactList: Loops through data, creating a series of contactItems

			-contactItem: Display the contact data


End Result shows the data flow hierarchy of components and how to update state to reflect user input.
